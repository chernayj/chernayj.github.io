Thereafter, Chernay accumulated four years of professional experience having worked as an economist at the South African Reserve Bank and in the investment-banking sector. In 2016, the Financial Mail ranked Chernay amongst the top-three young analysts in South Africa, in recognition of her economic research on sub-Saharan Africa. </p>
