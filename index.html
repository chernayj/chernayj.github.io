<p> After graduating with a Bachelor of Business Science degree in Economics in 2011, Chernay completed the prestigious Economist Internship Programme with the Bureau for Economic Research. Thereafter, Chernay accumulated four years of professional experience having worked as an economist at the South African Reserve Bank and in the investment-banking sector. In 2016, the Financial Mail ranked Chernay amongst the top-three young analysts in South Africa, in recognition of her economic research on sub-Saharan Africa. </p>

<p> Chernay also attained a Master of Economic Science degree through the University of the Witwatersrand in 2016, and in 2017 she embarked on a full-time PhD programme in Quantitative Finance with the University of Cape Town. Her research interests are around applied topics in financial economics, and empirical research excites her most. </p>

<p> Chernay is a proponent of the Black Girl Magic movement, and in her spare time she enjoys photography, travelling and rocking out at live music festivals. </p> -->
